## A Brief Intro

Hello and thank you for visiting my repository! I'm an entrepreneur who loves all things tech! As an accomplished musician and songwriter, when I'm not writing code, you'll often find me in my home studio recording, engineering and producing.
<br>
<br>
I am currently enrolled in the Tech Academyâ€™s Cyber Security Boot Camp, and am also receiving training in the following web and programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C# and more. Upon Boot Camp completion, I will be a full-stack developer with a focus on Cyber Security and would love the opportunity to work with a dynamic team and/or project. This repository contains various projects/assignments/challenges that I'm either working on, or have completed at the Tech Academy.
